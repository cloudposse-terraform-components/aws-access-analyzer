  This component is responsible for configuring AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer within an AWS
  Organization.

  IAM Access Analyzer helps you identify the resources in your organization and accounts, such as Amazon S3 buckets or IAM
  roles, shared with an external entity. This lets you identify unintended access to your resources and data, which is a
  security risk. IAM Access Analyzer identifies resources shared with external principals by using logic-based reasoning
  to analyze the resource-based policies in your AWS environment. For each instance of a resource shared outside of your
  account, IAM Access Analyzer generates a finding. Findings include information about the access and the external
  principal granted to it. You can review findings to determine if the access is intended and safe or if the access is
  unintended and a security risk. In addition to helping you identify resources shared with an external entity, you can
  use IAM Access Analyzer findings to preview how your policy affects public and cross-account access to your resource
  before deploying resource permissions. The findings are organized in a visual summary dashboard. The dashboard
  highlights the split between public and cross-account access findings, and provides a breakdown of findings by resource
  type.

  IAM Access Analyzer analyzes only policies applied to resources in the same AWS Region where it's enabled. To monitor
  all resources in your AWS environment, you must create an analyzer to enable IAM Access Analyzer in each Region where
  you're using supported AWS resources.

  AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer provides the following capabilities:

  - IAM Access Analyzer external access analyzers help identify resources in your organization and accounts that are
    shared with an external entity.

  - IAM Access Analyzer unused access analyzers help identify unused access in your organization and accounts.

  - IAM Access Analyzer validates IAM policies against policy grammar and AWS best practices.

  - IAM Access Analyzer custom policy checks help validate IAM policies against your specified security standards.

  - IAM Access Analyzer generates IAM policies based on access activity in your AWS CloudTrail logs.

  Here's a typical workflow:

  **Delegate Access Analyzer to another account**: From the Organization management (root) account, delegate
  administration to a specific AWS account within your organization (usually the security account).

  **Create Access Analyzers in the Delegated Administrator Account**: Enable the Access Analyzers for external access and
  unused access in the delegated administrator account.

  ## Deployment Overview

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      access-analyzer/defaults:
        metadata:
          component: access-analyzer
          type: abstract
        vars:
          enabled: true
          global_environment: gbl
          account_map_tenant: core
          root_account_stage: root
          delegated_administrator_account_name: core-mgt
          accessanalyzer_service_principal: "access-analyzer.amazonaws.com"
          accessanalyzer_organization_enabled: false
          accessanalyzer_organization_unused_access_enabled: false
          organizations_delegated_administrator_enabled: false
  ```

  ```yaml
  import:
    - catalog/access-analyzer/defaults

  components:
    terraform:
      access-analyzer/root:
        metadata:
          component: access-analyzer
          inherits:
            - access-analyzer/defaults
        vars:
          organizations_delegated_administrator_enabled: true
  ```

  ```yaml
  import:
    - catalog/access-analyzer/defaults

  components:
    terraform:
      access-analyzer/delegated-administrator:
        metadata:
          component: access-analyzer
          inherits:
            - access-analyzer/defaults
        vars:
          accessanalyzer_organization_enabled: true
          accessanalyzer_organization_unused_access_enabled: true
          unused_access_age: 30
  ```

  ### Provisioning

  Delegate Access Analyzer to the security account:

  ```bash
  atmos terraform apply access-analyzer/root -s plat-dev-gbl-root
  ```

  Provision Access Analyzers for external access and unused access in the delegated administrator (security) account in
  each region:

  ```bash
  atmos terraform apply access-analyzer/delegated-administrator -s plat-dev-use1-mgt
  ```
